make sure you create a project folder of some name and create a sub folder named ' templates ' and put this index.html in that folder and app.py outside that folder and those two would be enough and go to terminal , run command ,         " python -u app.py "
you could see a url localhost "http://127.0.0.1:5000" 
and on opening this , its done clicking the buttons displays diff results
